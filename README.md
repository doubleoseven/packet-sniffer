A sniffer (packet analyzer) is a program that intercepts the traffic passing through a network interface. In this project, we are going to implement our own packet sniffer using the libpcap library and to validate our program on actual network traffic

Getting Started:
1- check the demo file
2- read http://recursos.aldabaknocking.com/libpcapHakin9LuisMartinGarcia.pdf3- compile and run the samle code in demo file
4- start working on either Linux, or the MacOS version. 
5- fix bugs and add new features
